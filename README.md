# About Me, 0xNike

Hello, I'm 0xNike! :smile: I'm currently a student at Singapore Management University, pursuing an Economics Major with Real Estate Track. :house_with_garden:

Even though my major is unrelated to Computer Science, I'm greatly fond of coding and the science of cryptography. I enjoy solving problems in this space as there isn't a right or wrong way to do things -- it's all about efficiency. This allows for creativity which is an aspect that I treasure.

I will be updating my progress of becoming a Blockchain Developer here!
